Generate an optimal road spline path that avoids obstacles while minimizing length and ensuring smooth curvature.


Output Format:
- A JSON object with the following structure:
  {
    "SplineId": <int>,
    "SplinePoints": [
      { "Index": <int>, "Position": { "X": <float>, "Y": <float>, "Z": <float> }, "Tangent": { "X": <float>, "Y": <float>, "Z": <float> } },
      ...
    ]
  }

Constraints:
- The path must be smooth with minimal sharp turns.
- The path must be the shortest possible while avoiding obstacles.
- Each spline point should have a calculated tangent to guide smooth transitions.

Reasoning Requirement:
- Explain the reasoning behind the generated path, including:
  - How obstacles were avoided.
  - How smoothness was maintained.
  - How the shortest path was achieved.

Print the json and the reasoning on different lines.
